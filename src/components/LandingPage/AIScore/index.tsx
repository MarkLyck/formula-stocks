              There are multiple ways to invest intelligently. You have previously met Joe, who specializes in selecting
              individual winning stocks.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another approach is quantitative investing, where you invest in a "basket" of stocks, say 40 stocks, which
              sports certain winning traits. These traits are derived from more than 200 quantitative and qualitative
              factors, computed for each stock. Called the AI-score, a number between -100 and 100, indicating
              attractiveness.
              <br />
              <br />
              Consider a stock with -100 as something to avoid, and a stock with an AI-score of 100 as something to
              absolutely invest in. Since all supported stocks receive a score you can construct your own preferred
              portfolio or use it as a supporting investment tool. For each stock you also get access to a report,
              detailing risk vs. reward, value, growth, profitability, soundness and much more.
              <br />
              <br />
              If invested in 40 stocks with an AI-score {'>'} 80 a typical historical avg. return would have been 27%
              pro anno<sup>*</sup>. See study for further details.
